  "description": "Hi! I’m Sejal. I started my journey at Gitcoin, where I focused on community-driven grants and collaborative funding, and I’m now at Allo Capital exploring innovative funding mechanisms. I’m passionate about making Celo a hub for public goods, testing and building mechanisms that benefit everyone.  As a Celo PG Steward, I’m excited to bring my experience in PGF to support Celo’s mission."
