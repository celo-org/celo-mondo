  "description": "I’m originally a creative who thrives on helping builders and trailblazers find product-market fit in both business and life. Over the past two years, I’ve dedicated my energy to growing Celo’s ecosystem by leading initiatives in media, events, and opportunities that push the community forward. Becoming a delegate feels like a natural next step, allowing me to deepen my impact and serve as a voice for participants across the ecosystem."
