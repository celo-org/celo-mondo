  "description": "Hello Celorians, this is Joan_drb. I’ve been involved with the Celo ecosystem for the past 3 years and am currently co-leading CELO EU in its second season. I started as a builder, working as Head of Growth for EthicHub, and since then I’ve developed a genuine interest in leveraging blockchain to create fair business models. My goal with Celo is to help the ecosystem by building solutions that bridge the gap between Western societies and other economies."
