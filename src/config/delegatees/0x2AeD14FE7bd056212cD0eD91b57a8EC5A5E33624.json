  "description": "Hi folks, this is Rica. I’ve been involved with Celo in one way or another for over 2 years already. I co-founded PositiveBlockchain.io and ReFi Lisboa, and I'm  the host of planta-R, the Portuguese ReFi podcast. Recently, I stepped into the Marketing Lead role for Celo EU’s 2nd season.  As a creative strategist and marketer with over a decade of experience at the intersection of business, art, tech, and impact, I focus on projects that uphold civil liberties, champion equality, nurture democratic values, and safeguard our planet’s future. I’m driven by a belief in the power of collective intelligence and decentralized communities to create meaningful change."
