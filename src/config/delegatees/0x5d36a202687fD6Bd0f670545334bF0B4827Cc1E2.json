  "description": "Hi! I'm LauNaMu, I deeply resonate with Celo's mission to create a more financially inclusive world through building real world onchain products and particularly cover the needs in emerging markets. Having previously worked in Fintech at the intersection of Financial Inclusion and Emerging Markets I am excited to bring this knowledge along with my experience contributing to Optimism's governance to Celo as it joins the Superchain."
