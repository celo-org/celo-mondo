  "description": "Hi there! I'm Luiz Fernando âœ¨  Currently founder & lead at ReFi Barcelona and operations lead at ReFi DAO, I've spent the last 3 years organizing and supporting communities and programs across the Celo & ReFi space â€” initially with PrimeDAO and now through ReFi DAO, Regen Coordination and ReFi Barcelona. I'd like to promote interconnection within and between ReFi, Regen and local ecosystems - catalyzing grounded realâ€‘world adoption by local communities and economies, in the spirit of Ethereum Localism and Regen Coordination. ðŸŒ¿"
