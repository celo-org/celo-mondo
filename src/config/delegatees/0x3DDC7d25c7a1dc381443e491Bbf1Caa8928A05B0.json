  "description": "I’m Ignas, a solo researcher with the main focus on DeFi. My mission is to provide clear, in-depth insights helping my audiences stay up-to-date with the latest trends while actively supporting DAO development.  I believe in the decentralized future and it means actively participating in Arbitrum DAO in every way I can—whether it’s by serving as a delegate, joining working groups, discussing any proposals or seizing new opportunities that come up. I’ll also be sharing key DAO decisions on X and my blog."
