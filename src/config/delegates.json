It was a privilege to witness the amazing journey of the network development from Alfajores to Baklava and the growing nascent community. The Stake-Off competition brought together a set of highly competitive but remarkably helpful and cooperatives groups of validators. Those sleepless nights of the competition have paid off really well as we are one of the 65 Genesis Validators and the grateful producer of the first block of the chain :D"

Each set of nodes is geo-redundant by being hosted in different regions by different providers. Our own servers are hosted by a hosting provider certified in accordance with DIN ISO/IEC 27001. It also offers state of the art DDoS protection and multiple 100 GBit/s peering points on the backbone with guaranteed bandwidth of 1GBit/s."
