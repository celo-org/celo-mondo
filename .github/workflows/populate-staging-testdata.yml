name: Populate Staging Test Data

# This workflow populates the staging database with test proposal data
# covering all possible proposal states (26 different scenarios).
#
# Schedule: Runs every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
# Manual trigger: Actions tab -> "Populate Staging Test Data" -> "Run workflow"
#
# What it does:
# - Cleans up existing test data (proposal IDs 1000-1099)
# - Creates fresh test proposals with realistic blockchain data
# - Includes events, votes, and multisig approvals
# - Uses timestamps relative to current time for realistic data
#
# Safety:
# - Only runs on staging database (POSTGRES_URL_STAGING secret)
# - Won't affect production data
# - Idempotent: Safe to run multiple times
